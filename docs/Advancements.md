The Town Advancements feature provides a fun way of both teaching your players how to use HuskTowns and provide engaging challenges to keep growing them. 

Advancements are off by default, and can be enabled or disabled using the `do_advancements` option under `general` in your server [config](config-files). Town advancements can be customized through the `advancements.json` file, located in `/plugins/HuskTowns/`.
