HuskTowns provides additional [Permission Contexts](https://luckperms.net/wiki/Context) for [LuckPerms](https://luckperms.net), letting you restrict permission access based on contextual factors determined by HuskTowns. 

If you wish to, for instance, restrict certain commands behind a player being in a town, this is how you can do so.

## Requirements
* LuckPerms v5.3+ installed on your server
* HuskTowns installed on your server
* In HuskTowns' config.yml, ensure `luckperms_contexts_hook` is enabled under `general`.
